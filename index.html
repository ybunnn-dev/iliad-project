                <p>
                    For Aristotle, poetry was not mere ornament but mimesis or an imitation of human 
                    action that carries universal truths. Among the forms, tragedy and epic are the highest 
                    achievements.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Both aim to depict noble actions, although to him, tragedy is more concentrated and 
                    powerful while epic poetry unfolds across vast time and space. Tragedy compresses 
                    events into a light and dramatic unity that strikes the audience with greater 
                    immediacy.

They differ, however, from one another in three respects- the medium, the objects, the manner or mode of imitation, being in each case distinct.”

                    “Epic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in verse of characters of a higher type. They differ in that Epic poetry admits but one kind of meter and is narrative in form. They differ, again, in their length: for Tragedy endeavors, as far as possible, to confine itself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this limit, whereas the Epic action has no limits of time. This, then, is a second point of difference; though at first the same freedom was admitted in Tragedy as in Epic poetry.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Of their constituent parts some are common to both, some peculiar to Tragedy: whoever, therefore knows what is good or bad Tragedy, knows also about Epic poetry. All the elements of an Epic poem are found in Tragedy, but the elements of a Tragedy are not all found in the Epic poem.”

                    <p><b>1. Plot (Mythos)</b> – To Aristotle, the plot is the heart of a poetry. To have a good plot, a poetry must have a clear beginning, middle, and end. The events a poetry should follow logically or by necessity. A great plot includes:</p>

                        <p>
                            <b>c. Catharsis</b> - Here, the audience experiences pity and fear after witnessing the downfall of the characters through reversal and discovery. Thus, the emotions are then purged that leaves the audience not in despair, but rather with a sense of relief, clarity, and emotional renewal.

                    <b>2. Character (Ethos)</b> - These are the figures who enact the plot. Their choices and flaws give rise to action. Characters must be consistent, appropriate, and believable. These qualities will represent the character's moral qualities through their decisions.
                </p>

                <p class="element-item">
                    <b>3. Thought (Dianoia)</b> - These are often the themes, insights, and reasoning that are expressed in the play. Thought makes the tragedy intellectually meaningful and not just emotionally moving.

                    <b>4. Diction (Lexis)</b> - This is the style of speech and word choice. A good diction makes thought and plot more vivid, memorable, and beautiful.

                <p class="element-item">
                    <b>5. Song (Melos)</b> - is the musical element which is often the rhythm, harmony, and choral odes. Music enriches the emotional texture of the play.

                <p class="element-item">
                    <b>6. Spectacle (Opsis)</b> - These are the visual staging like costumes, scenery, effects. Aristotle however considered this as the least essential, since it depends on stagecraft more than on the poet’s art.

                    Written by the blind poet <b>Homer</b> around the 8th century BC, <i>The Iliad</i> is one of the oldest extant works of Western literature. It is set during the final year of the ten-year siege of Troy (Ilium) by a coalition of Greek states.

It explores how the anger of a single man shapes the fate of armies, exploring themes of glory (<i>Kleos</i>), fate, and the tragic cost of war.
