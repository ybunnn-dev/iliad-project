                        For Aristotle, poetry was not mere ornament but mimesis or an imitation of human 
                        action that carries universal truths. Among the forms, tragedy and epic are the highest 
                        achievements.

                        Both aim to depict noble actions, although to him, tragedy is more concentrated and 
                        powerful while epic poetry unfolds across vast time and space. Tragedy compresses 
                        events into a light and dramatic unity that strikes the audience with greater 
                        immediacy.

                    “Epic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in verse of characters of a higher type. They differ in that Epic poetry admits but one kind of meter and is narrative in form. They differ, again, in their length: for Tragedy endeavors, as far as possible, to confine itself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this limit, whereas the Epic action has no limits of time.”

                <p>
                    Written by the blind poet <b>Homer</b> around the 8th century BC, <i>The Iliad</i> is one of the oldest extant works of Western literature. It is set during the final year of the ten-year siege of Troy (Ilium) by a coalition of Greek states.

                <p>
                    While the war serves as the backdrop, the poem is not merely a chronicle of battle. Its primary focus is the <b>Rage of Achilles</b> (<i>Menin</i>). It explores how the anger of a single man shapes the fate of armies, exploring themes of glory (<i>Kleos</i>), fate, and the tragic cost of war.

                                Grieving and fueled by rage, Achilles reconciled with Agamemnon. Wearing new armor from Hephaestus, he returned to battle, slaughtering every Trojan he encountered.

                                Hector was chased around the city three times until Athena tricked him into confronting Achilles. Achilles killed him, tied his body to a chariot, and dragged him for 9 days around Patroclus’ tomb.

                                King Priam, guided by Hermes, entered the Greek camp to beg for his son's body. Moved by the plea and memories of his own father, Achilles agreed. A truce was declared so Hector could be honored with a proper funeral.

                    <h3>The Literary Canon</h3>
                    <p>
                        The <i>Iliad</i> is widely considered the "grandfather" of Western Literature. It established the standard for the Epic genre, introducing techniques like <i>in medias res</i> and epithets. Its structure influenced Virgil’s <i>Aeneid</i>, Dante’s <i>Inferno</i>, and Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost</i>.

                    <h3>The Heroic Code</h3>
                    <p>
                        The poem defines the ancient Greek concept of <b>Kleos</b> (undying glory). It presents the tragic paradox of the hero: to gain immortality in song, one must accept an early death. It forces the audience to question the cost of pride (<i>Hubris</i>) and the nature of honor.

                    <h3>The Human Cost</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unlike a simple tale of "Good vs. Evil," Homer humanizes the enemy. The poem ends not with a battle, but with Achilles weeping alongside King Priam. It reveals that while war may bring glory, its ultimate reality is shared grief and the destruction of beautiful things.
